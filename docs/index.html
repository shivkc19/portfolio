        <p>I am a PMI Certified Project Management Professional (PMP) with over 8 years of experience in leading projects for major Global IT firms. My expertise lies in Agile and Hybrid project development methodologies, where I've effectively managed resources, budgets, and schedules.

Growing up, I had the privilege of living in seven different cities across India, and my career has taken me to three more cities in the north and south of the country.</p><br>
            
        <p>Over the years, I've accumulated five years of experience in the IT sector. I hold not just one but two post-graduate degrees, with my latest achievement being a degree in Advanced Project Management & Strategic Leadership from Canada.</p><br>
